# SAT-COMM

Satellite Communication 

## LoRa

LoRa is Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technology from Semtech. It started as a protocol for builliding long-range (hence LoRa) low-power network for Internet of Things (IoT). It has now become popular for satellite communication for tinySats since low-bandwidth data can be transferred with very little energy which is attractive for tinySats with tiny batteries.
