# Orbit Lab., Silicon Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar

Orbit Lab is Silicon Institute of Technology (SiliconTech) initiative to develop a satellite program using one of the nano-satellite formats, **CubeSat**. This program will be used as vehicle to undergraduate and graduate students to work on cutting-edge problems from all engineering branches including computer science, electrical, electronics and mechanical.

## Current Activities 

### TinyGS Ground Station

[TinyGS](https://tinygs.com) is an open network of Ground Stations distributed around the world to receive and operate LoRa satellites, weather probes and other satellites, using low-cost and versatile receiver modules based on ESP32 Wifi chipset and sx126x/sx127x LoRa chipset. The goal of this project is to jump-start the satellite program with minimum capital expense. This will not only help setup the ground station for our future CubeSat satellite but also provide us with vital information about the orbiting satellites that will help us design our own nano-satellite.
