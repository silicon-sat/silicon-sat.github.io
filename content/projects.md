### TinyGS Ground Station

[TinyGS](https://tinygs.com) is an open network of Ground Stations distributed around the world to receive and operate LoRa satellites, weather probes and other satellites, using low-cost and versatile receiver modules based on ESP32 Wifi chipset and sx126x/sx127x LoRa chipset. The goal of this project is to jump-start the satelitte program with minimum capital expense. This will not only help setup the ground station for our future PocketQube (or CubeSat) satellites but also provide us with vital information about the orbiting satellites that will help us design our own nano-sateliite.
