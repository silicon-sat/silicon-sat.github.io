## TinyGS Ground Station

[TinyGS](https://tinygs.com) is an open network of Ground Stations distributed around the world to receive and operate LoRa satellites, weather probes and other satellites, using low-cost and versatile receiver modules based on ESP32 Wifi chipset and sx126x/sx127x LoRa chipset. The goal of this project is to jump-start the satelitte program with minimum capital expense. This will not only help setup the ground station for our future PocketQube (or CubeSat) satellites but also provide us with vital information about the orbiting satellites that will help us design our own nano-sateliite.

## Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS)

The goal of this project is to come up with a ADCS strategy that involves minimum payload while keeping the R&D time reasonably short. 

## Python-based Orbital Environment Simulator

The objective of the Orbital Environment Simulator is to model the first- and second-order orbital dynamics of the satellite so that electro-mechanical systems sich as ADCS can be simulated to reasonable accuracy. Since the primary goal of this satellite program is to keep everything open-source, Python becomes a suitable choice.
